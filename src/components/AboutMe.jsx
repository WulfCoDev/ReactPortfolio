          <h3>About Me:</h3>
          <p>I am a Web Developer with a background in IT/Tech repair and have over a decade of graphic design experience. I am seeking remote opportunities as a Web Developer or Software Engineer.</p>
          <p>I currently work for Amazon while I complete Fullstack Academy's Web Development program and am also being AWS Cloud Practitioner certified.</p>
          <p>What drew me to web development is the ability to express my creativity whilst
            leveraging my design skills from my graphic design experience. <br></br> On the other hand, web development succumbs my need for problem-solving and constant self-evolution; growth. <br></br>In my free time, you can find me sim-racing or just hanging out with friends on Discord. I also enjoy making 3D prints and other things such as custom stickers, clothes, etc.</p>
